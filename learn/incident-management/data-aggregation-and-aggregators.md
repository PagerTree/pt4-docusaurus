# Data Aggregation and Aggregators

With over[ 328 million terabytes of data created daily](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day), it’s no wonder data aggregation tools are becoming increasingly important in almost every industry. In this article, we will define data aggregation, explain how it works, and explain why it is important for you and your business. We will also offer a few tools and solutions to help you and your business with data aggregation.

## What is Data Aggregation?

Data aggregation is the process of collecting, processing, and presenting, typically large data sets from multiple sources into more specific, easily digestible summaries. Simply put, _data aggregation helps businesses sift through large amounts of data to find the information they need, presenting that data in a consumable way._

A simple example of data aggregation is when you summarize the daily expenses of your business and then combine that data into a monthly summary. This approach helps you avoid dealing with 365 separate line items for expenses, and you can easily view your expenses for the entire month. You can then create an average daily expense if needed without manually entering 30 days' worth of data to obtain the information you need.

## What is a Data Aggregator?

_A data aggregator is a tool or service that collects data from one or multiple sources, combines it, and presents it in a simplified, cohesive format._ Data aggregators are utilized in various industries globally to improve decision-making, reduce labor overhead, and consolidate information for a more comprehensive perspective.

In short, data aggregators:

1. **Collect Data:** Data aggregators pull information from one or many sources.
2. **Process Data:** After collection, data aggregators merge data into more cohesive datasets.
3. **Present Data:** After merging, data is organized and presented in an easier-to-read format.

## What is Data Aggregation Used For?

Data aggregation is used for a variety of purposes across different industries, helping organizations make sense of large data sets and derive meaningful insights. Here are some use cases of data aggregation:

1. **Business Intelligence:** By aggregating data from various sources, businesses can get a comprehensive view of their operations, customer behavior, and market trends. This helps in making informed decisions, planning strategies, and optimizing processes.
2. **Improving Data Quality and Efficiency:** Aggregation helps in cleaning and refining data, which reduces redundancy and enhances the quality of the data. This process simplifies data analysis and improves the efficiency of data storage and management.
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Organizations use data aggregation to [monitor](https://pagertree.com/blog/system-monitoring-7-best-apm-tools) and analyze performance metrics across different departments or sectors. This is crucial for [assessing the productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-observability) of various business operations.
4. **Risk Management:** In sectors like finance and healthcare, data aggregation is crucial for risk assessment and management. By analyzing aggregated data, companies can identify potential risks and vulnerabilities early, allowing for proactive measures to be taken.
5. **Marketing and Customer Insights:** Aggregating data about customer interactions, preferences, and behaviors helps in crafting targeted marketing strategies. This can lead to better customer engagement, improved service delivery, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

## How Does Data Aggregation Work?

Data aggregation is a fundamental process in [data management](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/what-is-data-management) and analysis, involving three main stages: collection, processing, and presentation. Each stage plays a critical role in transforming raw data into actionable insights.

1. **Collection:** The first step in data aggregation is collecting data. This stage involves gathering data from multiple databases, systems, or external sources. Effective collection requires comprehensive systems to ensure data is accurately and consistently retrieved.
2. **Processing:** Once data is collected, the next step is processing. This stage involves cleaning and organizing the data to ensure it is useful for analysis. Processing may include filtering out irrelevant data, correcting errors, and resolving inconsistencies.
3. **Presentation:** The final stage of data aggregation is presentation. This stage involves translating the processed data into a format that is easy to understand and actionable for decision-makers. This often means visualizing the data in charts, graphs, or tables that highlight the key insights from the data aggregation process.

## Why is Data Aggregation Important?

Data aggregation is a crucial process that enables businesses to gain a holistic view of a particular subject matter. This process provides valuable insights that can be used to make informed decisions. By identifying significant trends and patterns, data aggregation helps to optimize resource management. Comprehensive data analysis enhances operational efficiency and streamlines processes.

## Data Aggregation Example

<figure>![PagerTree Data Aggregation](<../.gitbook/assets/Data Aggregation (12).png>)<figcaption><p>PagerTree Alert Aggregation</p></figcaption></figure>

An example of data aggregation can be illustrated using [PagerTree](https://pagertree.com/), an oncall management solution that streamlines the process of handling alerts. In environments where IT and support teams receive numerous notifications from various monitoring tools, the risk of [alert fatigue](https://pagertree.com/blog/the-science-of-on-call) is high due to the sheer volume of alerts that may not be immediately actionable or relevant.

PagerTree addresses this challenge by aggregating alerts into single notifications. Here’s how it works:

1. **Collection of Alerts:** PagerTree [integrates](https://pagertree.com/integrations/) with various [monitoring systems](https://pagertree.com/blog/system-monitoring-7-best-apm-tools) and tools that generate alerts. These could be about system outages, performance anomalies, or other critical events.
2. **Data Aggregation Process:** Instead of sending each alert individually to the oncall team, PagerTree [aggregates](https://pagertree.com/features/alert-aggregation-and-deduplication/) these alerts based on predefined criteria such as alert type, [severity level](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/severity-levels), the system affected, or time of occurrence. This process involves analyzing the context and content of each alert to determine how they should be grouped together or aggregated.
3. **Notification Delivery:** PagerTree sends a consolidated notification to the user or team. This notification provides a comprehensive but succinct overview of the situation, allowing the recipient to quickly understand the scope and scale of the issue without having to process each alert individually.
4. **Action and Response:** With a clearer, aggregated view of alerts, oncall teams can prioritize their responses more effectively, address critical issues promptly, and [reduce downtime or service disruptions](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/how-to-calculate-mttr-and-other-common-incident-recovery-metrics).

This example is just one of many use cases for data aggregation.

## Data Aggregation Tools

Data aggregation tools, also known as data aggregators, play a key role in presenting large amounts of data in a consumable and beneficial way. Some data aggregators can be designed for specific industries and use cases, while other data aggregators are designed to be more generalized and all-encompassing.

Here are a few data aggregators:

* [Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi) (Microsoft): This data aggregator is designed for end-to-end business intelligence and aggregated data visualization.
* [Google Data Studio](https://cloud.google.com/looker-studio?hl=en) (Looker Studio): Useful for creating visual representations from aggregated data.
* [Matillion:](https://www.matillion.com/) Powerful tool for complex data aggregations, offering extensive query capabilities.
* [Qlik:](https://www.qlik.com/us) A leading tool for business analytics with many tools to assist in data aggregation.

## Conclusion

Data aggregation is crucial for enabling organizations to transform raw data into actionable insights. By using proper aggregation techniques and tools, businesses can enhance their decision-making processes, boost operational efficiencies, and maintain a competitive edge in their industries. As data continues to expand in both volume and complexity, the importance of data aggregation will only become more significant.
