# Severity Levels

## What are severity levels?

**Incident severity levels measure the impact an incident has on the business**. Severity levels are useful for quickly understanding and concisely communicating the impact of an incident.

Incidents can be classified by severity, usually a "SEV" definition. Severities rank from SEV-1 to SEV-5. The lower the severity number, the more impactful the incident. Anything above a SEV-3 should automatically be considered a "major incident".

:::tip
Always assume the worst - If you are unsure which severity an incident should be, treat it as the higher one.

| Severity | Description                                                                           | Example                                                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEV-1    | Critical incident with very high impact.                                              | A customer facing service is completely down for all customers.   |
| SEV-2    | Critical incident with significant impact.                                            | A customer facing service is down for a subset of customers.      |
| SEV-3    | Minor incident with low impact.                                                       | Partial loss of functionality causing inconvenience to customers. |
| SEV-4    | Minor issues requiring action, but not affecting customer ability to use the service. | Slower than average load times.                                   |
| SEV-5    | Cosmetic issues or bugs not affecting customer ability to use the service.            | Application text is misspelled.                                   |
