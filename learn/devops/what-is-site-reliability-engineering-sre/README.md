# What is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)?

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a specialized discipline under the [DevOps](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops) umbrella. Google initially conceptualized [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site\_reliability\_engineering) in 2003. It blends software engineering principles with infrastructure and operations management. By leveraging automation, [deployment strategies](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-site-reliability-engineering-sre/what-is-a-canary-deployment), monitoring, observability, and a deep understanding of system architecture, SREs aim to create and maintain scalable, reliable, and efficient software systems.

## Why is Site Reliability Engineering Important?

In todayâ€™s growing technological landscape, consumers demand more features, faster service, and [high availability](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/hybrid-work/what-is-high-availability.html). The balancing act required to ensure services meet customers' expectations is difficult for most organizations; that is where SREs come into play. Developers focus primarily on following the production cycle and pushing value-added features into services. SREs, on the other hand, focus mainly on enhancing the reliability and availability of systems, directly impacting user satisfaction. [Downtime](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/how-to-calculate-mttr-and-other-common-incident-recovery-metrics#downtime) or disruptions of service can cause significant losses for a service provider, both monetarily and for their reputation. SRE practices help mitigate these risks by proactively identifying and addressing potential issues before they become major incidents.

## What are the Key Principles of Site Reliability Engineering?

SRE key principles can be broken down into:

* Automation
* Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
* Maintaining Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
* Embracing and Managing Risk

\
**Automation:** by automating repetitive and manual tasks, SREs reduce the likelihood of human error and free up time for more strategic activities. This automation extends to incident response, where predefined procedures, like [detection and response](https://pagertree.com/learn#detect), can help quickly resolve issues.

**Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** SREs implement comprehensive [monitoring systems](https://pagertree.com/blog/system-monitoring-7-best-apm-tools) that provide real-time insights into system performance and health. Monitoring improves observability, allowing for early detection and swift response to anomalies, minimizing downtime, and maintaining service reliability.

**Maintaining Service Level Objectives (SLOs):** These are explicit goals for system performance and availability, which guide the SREs' efforts. [SLOs](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli) ensure that everyone understands the expected service levels and that there are clear benchmarks for measuring success.

**Embracing and Managing Risk:** SREs understand that 100% service availability is impossible, but SREs embrace risk to improve system resilience by learning from failures, [taking calculated risks](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/how-to-calculate-mttr-and-other-common-incident-recovery-metrics#error-budget), and managing known issues.

## What is Observability and Monitoring in Site Reliability Engineering?

Observability and monitoring are critical to effective Site Reliability Engineering. With a proper understanding of service, hardware, and system performance, SREs can enhance availability and reliability. Monitoring refers to using tools such as [Prometheus](https://pagertree.com/learn/prometheus/overview) and [DataDog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) to collect and analyze data from various parts of the system to ensure everything functions as expected. On the other hand, observability is about understanding your system's internal state through the outputs it produces or the data collected by monitoring tools.

SREs employ a range of tools and techniques to achieve observability. Metrics, logs, and traces, referred to as [The Pillars of Observability](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-observability#the-pillars-of-observability), are the primary components of observability.&#x20;

* **Metrics:** provide quantitative data on system performance, such as response times and error rates.&#x20;
* **Logs:** offer detailed records of system events, helping diagnose issues.&#x20;
* **Traces:** Traces track the flow of requests through the system, providing insights into how different components interact and where bottlenecks may occur.

## What are the Key Metrics for Site Reliability Engineering?

Metrics are vital for SREs in assessing and improving system reliability, but monitoring every possible metric, even with [data aggregators](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/data-aggregation-and-aggregators), creates too much data to sift through to find problems and bottlenecks. SREs should focus efforts on monitoring and collecting specific metrics to gain better observability of their system.\
\
Methods developed by Brendan Gregg and Tom Wilkie, like the [RED and USE methods](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-observability/use-and-red-method), give a great starting point for monitoring and troubleshooting systems. The RED method focuses on troubleshooting service-related issues, such as monitoring rates, errors, and durations. The USE method focuses more on hardware-related issues, such as monitoring utilization, saturation, and errors. Working in unison, these two methods give a comprehensive system view, improving overall observability.

### SRE Key Metrics:

* **Availability:** The % of time a service is available.
* **SLO:** The internal goals set for service levels.
* **SLI:** The measured performance of services.
* **Utilization:** The % of time the monitored resource was busy.
* **Saturation:** Workload beyond the system's capacity.
* **Errors (Hardware):** The number of failures occurring in the system.
* **Rate:** The number of requests a service handles per second.
* **Errors (Service):** The count of failed requests.
* **Duration:** The measurement of how long it takes to process a request.

## How Does Site Reliability Engineering Work?

Site Reliability Engineering operates at the intersection of development and operations. SREs collaborate closely with both development teams and IT operations, ensuring that systems are both scalable and reliable. They employ a combination of automation, rigorous testing, and continuous monitoring to achieve this goal.

A typical SRE workflow involves defining risk tolerance, setting up monitoring systems, and automating deployment and incident response processes. When an incident occurs, SREs follow predefined playbooks to resolve the issue swiftly.
