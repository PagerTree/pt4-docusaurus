# Best DevOps Build Tools

The build phase is a critical stage in the software [development lifecycle](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/best-devops-tools) where source code is compiled and assembled into deliverable artifacts, such as executable files, libraries, or deployable packages. This phase is essential to the [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/what-is-ci-cd#what-is-continuous-integration-ci) pipeline, as it consolidates code from various contributors, allowing for the early detection and resolution of integration issues, dependencies, and potential conflicts. In the build phase of the [DevOps lifecycle](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/what-are-the-benefits-of-devops), teams need to be aware of multiple types of tools, including build automation, containerization, and artifact management/repository tools. Each plays a vital role in the DevOps and [CI/CD pipelines](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/best-ci-cd-tools).

## Build Automation Tools

Build [automation tools](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/devops-infrastructure-and-automation#infrastructure-automation-in-devops) are software applications that automate compiling, testing, packaging, and deploying software applications. They are a crucial component of the [DevOps pipeline](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/what-is-a-devops-pipeline), facilitating continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD). These tools help streamline the build process, ensure consistency, and reduce manual effort and [toil](https://pagertree.com/blog/site-reliability-engineer-sre-interview-questions#id-23.-what-is-toil-reduction-and-how-is-it-achieved).

### Build Automation Tools Include:

* [**Gradle**](https://gradle.org/) - (Free & Paid) is a build automation tool that supports multiple programming languages. It allows developers to define custom build logic and manage dependencies. Gradle's incremental build feature helps speed up the build process, making it a practical choice for projects of all sizes.
* [**Jenkins**](https://www.jenkins.io/) - (Open Source) is a popular open-source automation server for continuous integration and continuous delivery ([CI/CD](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/what-is-a-devops-engineer#continuous-integration-and-continuous-deployment-ci-cd)). It supports various plugins, enabling developers to automate various stages of the software development lifecycle, including building, testing, and deploying applications.
* [**Travis CI**](https://www.travis-ci.com/) - (Open Source) is a cloud-based continuous integration service that automates the build and testing process for projects. It helps ensure that code changes do not introduce new issues. Travis CI is easy to set up and supports multiple programming languages.
* [**GitHub Actions**](https://github.com/features/actions) - (Free & Paid) is a CI/CD tool integrated into [GitHub](https://github.com/). It allows developers to automate workflows directly from their GitHub repositories, including code testing and deployment. GitHub Actions supports custom workflows and integrates well with other tools and services.
* [**NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Free) is the JavaScript package manager and is widely used in the [Node.js](http://node.js) ecosystem. It manages dependencies and includes features for automating build scripts, such as linting, testing, and compiling code. NPM scripts can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines, helping streamline the build process.

## Containerization Tools

Containerization tools are software applications that enable container creation, deployment, and management. [Containers](https://pagertree.com/learn/docker/containers) are lightweight, portable units that package an application and its dependencies, allowing them to run consistently across different computing environments. These tools are crucial in modern software development and development and DevOps practices, as they provide a consistent runtime environment and simplify the deployment process.

<figure>![Containerization Tools](<../../.gitbook/assets/Containerization Tools.png>)<figcaption><p>Containerization Tools</p></figcaption></figure>

### Containerization Tools Include:

* [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) - (Open Source) is widely used in the build phase of the DevOps pipeline to package applications and their dependencies into containers. [Containerization](https://pagertree.com/learn/docker/containers) ensures that the application can run consistently across different environments, from development to production. [Docker](https://pagertree.com/learn/docker/overview) containers simplify testing and deployment, making them a key component of CI/CD
* [**Podman**](https://podman.io/) - (Open Source) is a container management tool that functions without a [daemon](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/daemon). It is compatible with Docker images and commands, making creating, building, and managing container images easy. Podman's support for rootless containers provides a secure option for handling container builds.
* [**Buildah**](https://buildah.io/) - (Open Source) is a tool for building [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) container images, which is particularly useful during the build phase. It allows developers to create and modify container images without needing a running container daemon, making it a practical choice for integrating custom [images](https://pagertree.com/learn/docker/images) into CI/CD workflows.
* [**Canonical LXD**](https://canonical.com/lxd) - (Open Source) is a Linux-based tool that manages full-system containers, providing a virtual machine-like experience with containers. It is useful for testing and building applications that require a complete operating system environment. LXD ensures a consistent and isolated environment for building and testing applications.

## Artifact Management Tools

Artifact management tools are software applications that store, manage, and distribute binary files, [build artifacts](https://instatus.com/blog/devops-artifacts), and create dependencies during software development and deployment. These artifacts can include compiled binaries, libraries, documentation, configuration files, Docker images, and other components necessary for building and deploying applications. Artifact management tools help ensure consistency, version control, and security across different environments.

It supports version control and integrates with various CI/CD tools to automate build and deployment processes. BitBucket also offers artifact storage, enabling teams to manage their software artifacts alongside their code.
* [**Sonatype Nexus**](https://www.sonatype.com/products/sonatype-nexus-oss) - (Free & Paid) is a versatile repository manager that supports a wide range of repository formats, such as [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), npm, NuGet, and more. It provides a centralized location for storing and managing build artifacts, making it easy for teams to share and retrieve software components, ensuring consistency and reusability.
* [**NuGet**](https://www.nuget.org/) - (Free) is a package manager designed for the [.NET ecosystem](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/). It simplifies the management of libraries and dependencies by hosting .NET packages. Developers can easily share, install, and update packages within their projects, streamlining the development workflow.
* [**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/) - (Free & Paid) is a cloud-based repository for Docker images. It allows developers to store, share, and manage container images, facilitating the distribution of applications and their dependencies. Docker Hub supports public and private repositories and integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines for efficient automation.

Choosing the right tools during the build phase of the DevOps pipeline is critical to setting yourself and your team up for success. Ensure you spend time digging into each tool and ensuring it meets the needs of your team and project.

The next phase of the DevOps life cycle is testing. Check out our “[Best  DevOps Testing Tools](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/best-devops-tools/best-devops-testing-tools)” article for tools to assist you in this phase.
