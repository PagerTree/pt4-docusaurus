# Best DevOps Coding Tools

The coding phase of the [DevOps lifecycle](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/top-25-devops-interview-questions#id-4.-what-is-the-devops-lifecycle) is where a team starts working on writing code and developing software. To assist in this phase, there are two types of tools to be aware of: source code management tools and integrated development environment (IDE) tools. For development and [operations teams](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-site-reliability-engineering-sre), picking a source code management tool is about understanding how your team will work together, the tools you may already use, and how teams will [effectively collaborate](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/what-are-the-benefits-of-devops#id-2.-enhanced-collaboration-and-communication) throughout your entire project. On an individual developer level, picking the correct IDE tool is wholly based on the type of project you are working on, and the language you are building your project in.

Before teams begin to write code and build your project, it is important to ensure everyone is on the same page, goals are outlined, and project scope has been determined. If you’re looking for tools to assist in the DevOps planning phase, check out our “[Best DevOps Planning Tools](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/best-devops-tools/best-devops-planning-tools)” article.

## DevOps Source Code Management Tools

Effective source code management is the backbone of any [DevOps workflow](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops). Ensuring that code changes are tracked, collaborative development is seamless, and version control is maintained is just as important as coding itself. This section will explore the top source code management tools that help [DevOps teams](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/what-is-a-devops-engineer) streamline their coding processes, enhance collaboration, and deliver high-quality software faster and more efficiently.

**DevOps Code Management Tools include:**

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - (Free & Paid) is a widely used platform for hosting and reviewing code, managing projects, and building software alongside other developers. It offers collaboration features, multiple integrations, and supports both public and private repositories.
* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) - (Free & Paid) is an [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) product that provides [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Mercurial code](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) repositories with a strong focus on continuous integration and deployment. It integrates seamlessly with other Atlassian products like [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and [Trello](https://trello.com/), making it a powerful tool for managing complex development projects.
* [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) - (Free & Paid) is an all-in-one DevOps platform that combines source code management with [CI/CD pipelines](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd), project planning, and security features. Its comprehensive suite of tools supports the entire DevOps lifecycle from planning to [monitoring](https://pagertree.com/blog/site-reliability-engineer-sre-interview-questions#id-8.-what-is-the-difference-between-logging-monitoring-and-tracing).
* [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/) - (Free & Paid) is a fully managed source control service hosted by Amazon Web Services. It supports Git repositories and is designed for scalability, security, and seamless integration with other AWS services, making it ideal for enterprises already utilizing the AWS ecosystem.

## DevOps Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Tools

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are essential for DevOps professionals. They provide comprehensive tools to write, debug, and test code efficiently. These all-in-one environments enhance productivity by offering features like syntax highlighting, [version control integration](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/), and real-time collaboration. This section will delve into the best IDE tools that streamline development workflows, foster teamwork, and support high-quality software's rapid iteration and deployment.

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - (Free) is a versatile and lightweight code editor by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) that supports multiple programming languages. It offers many extensions, integrated Git control, and a highly customizable environment, making it a favorite among developers.
* [AndroidStudio](https://developer.android.com/studio) - (Free) is the official IDE for [Android](https://www.android.com/) development. Provided by Google, it offers powerful tools for designing, debugging, and testing Android applications, along with seamless integration with the Android SDK and extensive device emulator support.
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - (Free) is Apple's integrated development environment for macOS. It is used to develop software for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It includes a suite of tools for coding, testing, and debugging applications, with strong support for Swift and Objective-C.
* [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/) - (Free) is an open-source IDE primarily used for [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) development but extensible to other programming languages through plugins. It supports comprehensive project management, debugging, and version control, making it suitable for complex, large-scale development projects.
* [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) - (Paid) is an AI-powered code completion tool that integrates into various IDEs, including Visual Studio Code. It assists developers by suggesting whole lines or blocks of code based on the current context, significantly boosting coding efficiency and creativity.

Collaboration, automation, rapid iterations, and deployment are the cornerstones of the DevOps philosophy. Picking tools that will foster an environment of collaboration and CI/CD is just as important as implementing DevOps practices. Ensure you take the time to explore these coding tools and pick the tool that will best suit your team's needs.
