# Best DevOps Tools for Each Phase of the DevOps Lifecycle

As technology continues to integrate more and more with our everyday lives, businesses need to be able to deliver and improve services quickly and efficiently to stay competitive. [DevOps practices](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops#devops-practices) aim to combine development and operations teams to improve the software delivery and development process through collaboration and automation. Part of those practices is the DevOps Lifecycle, a structured approach covering every aspect of the development lifecycle from planning to deployment.
