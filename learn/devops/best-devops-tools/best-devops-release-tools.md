# Best DevOps Release Tools

The release phase of the DevOps lifecycle focuses on preparing code for deployment by publishing built and tested code into a central repository to be deployed later. [Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/what-is-ci-cd) tools are critical to automating the delivery process, ensuring software is ready for deployment, reducing manual interventions, and providing consistent, [reliable](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli), and fast releases. This article will explore the best DevOps release phase tools to help you streamline your software delivery process.

## CI/CD Automation Tools

CI/CD automation tools are crucial in multiple phases of the DevOps lifecycle, including the release phase. In the previous lifecycle phases ([coding](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/best-devops-tools/best-devops-coding-tools) and [building](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/best-devops-tools/best-devops-build-tools) phases), [CI/CD tools](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/best-ci-cd-tools) were utilized by [developers](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/what-is-a-devops-engineer) to regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, ensuring code integrates properly without conflicts. CI/CD tools, partnered with the tools in the [testing phase](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/best-devops-tools/best-devops-testing-tools), automatically test builds to ensure code is ready for release. In the release phase, [CI/CD](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/what-is-ci-cd) tools ensure applications are packaged and releasable, ensuring all changes are prepared for the next lifecycle phase, [deployment](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/best-devops-tools/best-devops-deployment-tools).

### CI/CD Automation Tools Include:

* [**Jenkins**](https://www.jenkins.io/) (Open Source) automates the final steps of putting code into a deliverable state. It handles the automation of building, testing, and packaging the software, ensuring the final product is ready for deployment.
* [**GitLab CI/CD**](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/) (Free & Paid) automates the entire pipeline, including code compilation, testing, artifact generation, and containerization. It integrates with multiple [containerization tools](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/best-devops-tools/best-devops-build-tools#containerization-tools) and its own [Version Control System](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/source-code-management/) (VCS), streamlining the packaging processes and ensuring code is ready for deployment.
* [**Travis CI**](https://www.travis-ci.com/) (Free & Paid) automates the testing, building, release, and deployment phases. It ensures application code is thoroughly tested and validated before being packaged into deliverable artifacts. Travis CI facilitates seamless transitions from code commits to production-ready releases by integrating closely with source code management software like [GitHub](https://github.com/).
* [**CircleCI**](https://circleci.com/) (Free & Paid) optimizes the release phase by automating the process of turning source code into a deployable software release. It orchestrates the build, test, and packaging processes, using parallel execution and custom workflows to accelerate the time to release.

* [**Bamboo**](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo) (Paid) automates the build, test, and deployment phases, ensuring that software is in a deliverable state during the release phase. Its integration with other [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) tools allows for coordinated release management, helping teams seamlessly deploy the final product to various environments.
* [**RazerOps**](https://razorops.com/) (Free & Paid) automates the build and deployment processes, particularly for [containerized applications](https://pagertree.com/learn/docker/overview). In the release phase, RazerOps ensures that all components are appropriately tested and packaged into deployable units that are ready for release. This automation helps maintain consistency and reliability in the delivery process.
* [**Buildkite**](https://buildkite.com/) (Free & Paid) automates the final stages of preparing software for release, using self-hosted agents to handle build and test processes. By providing control over the build environment, Buildkite ensures that the code is packaged correctly and is in a deployable state, ready for [production deployment](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-site-reliability-engineering-sre/what-is-a-canary-deployment).
* [**DeployBot**](https://deploybot.com/) (Free & Paid) automates software release to various environments.

## Central Repository Tools

Central repository tools are essential during the [DevOps release phase](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/top-25-devops-interview-questions#id-4.-what-is-the-devops-lifecycle). They offer a [secure](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/what-is-a-devops-engineer#security) and structured method for storing, managing, and distributing artifacts like binaries, packages, and container images. These tools guarantee that the correct versions of software components are available for deployment by supporting artifact versioning and managing access control.
