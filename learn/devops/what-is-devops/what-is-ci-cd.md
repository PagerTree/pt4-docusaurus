# What is CI/CD?

Businesses need to respond quickly and effectively to software development needs to meet their customers' requirements. This is where practices like Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) come into play for [development teams](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops). By ensuring that code changes are continuously and seamlessly integrated and deployed, teams can deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently. But what is CI/CD?

**CI/CD is a methodology that automates the integration and delivery of code changes, improving how software is developed and deployed.** By continuously integrating code changes into a shared repository and automating the deployment process, teams can detect issues early, reduce manual errors, and [release software faster](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/top-25-devops-interview-questions#id-7.-name-three-important-devops-key-performance-indicators-kpis).

## What is Continuous Integration (CI)?

Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared [repository](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/best-devops-tools/best-devops-coding-tools#devops-source-code-management-tools). Each integration is automatically verified by running automated builds and tests, allowing teams to detect integration issues early. CI promotes collaboration and ensures that code changes are consistently tested, leading to [higher-quality software](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/what-are-the-benefits-of-devops#id-4.-higher-quality-and-reliability) releases.

### Key Components of CI:

* **Frequent Commits:** [Developers](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/what-is-a-devops-engineer) commit code changes regularly, minimizing the risk of integration conflicts.
* **Automated Testing:** Automated tests run on every commit to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.
* **Build Automation:** The build process is automated, ensuring consistency and reliability.
* **Immediate Feedback:** Developers receive immediate feedback on the status of their changes, enabling quick resolution of issues.

## What is Continuous Delivery (CD)?

Continuous Delivery (CD) extends the principles of CI by automating the delivery process, ensuring that code changes are always in a deployable state. With CD, every change that passes the automated tests is automatically prepared for a release to production. This approach reduces the risk associated with deployments and allows for faster and more [frequent releases](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/devops-vs.-agile).

### Key Components of CD:

* **Automated Delivery:** The delivery process is automated, reducing manual errors and ensuring consistency.
* **Staging Environment:** Changes are deployed to a staging environment that closely mirrors production, allowing for thorough testing.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Managing [infrastructure](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/devops-infrastructure-and-automation#what-is-devops-infrastructure) through code ensures that environments are reproducible and consistent.
* **Monitoring and Logging:** [Monitoring](https://pagertree.com/blog/system-monitoring-7-best-apm-tools) and logging systems track application performance and detect issues early.

:::tip
The CD in CI/CD is sometimes confused with continuous deployment. The largest difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment is that continuous deployment automates the entire process, including the deployment to production, allowing every change that passes automated tests to be released without human intervention.

## CI/CD Best Practices

Implementing CI/CD effectively requires adherence to best practices that ensure smooth and reliable processes.

**CI/CD Practices Include:**

1. **Frequent Commits:** Commit code changes often to catch integration issues early.
2. **Comprehensive Automated Testing:** Implement a wide range of automated tests to validate changes.
3. **Fast Builds:** Optimize the build process to provide quick feedback.
4. **Use Version Control:** Employ version control systems like [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to manage code changes.
5. **Maintain Build Health:** Fix failing builds immediately to prevent further issues.
6. **Automate Deployments:** Automate the deployment process to staging and production environments.
7. **Infrastructure as Code (**[**IaC**](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/devops-infrastructure-and-automation#infrastructure-as-code-iac-in-devops)**):** Manage infrastructure using code to ensure consistency across environments.
8. **Monitor and Log:** Implement monitoring and logging systems to track performance and detect issues.

## CI/CD Vs. DevOps

While CI/CD focuses on automating the integration and delivery of code changes, [DevOps](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/devops-vs.-agile) is a broader cultural and organizational movement that aims to improve collaboration between development and operations teams. Hereâ€™s how they compare:

* **Scope:** CI/CD is a subset of DevOps, focusing on automation within the development lifecycle. DevOps encompasses a wider range of practices and cultural changes.
* **Goals:** CI/CD aims to automate and streamline code integration and delivery. DevOps seeks to improve overall software delivery speed, quality, and collaboration.
* **Cultural Aspect:** CI/CD is primarily about technical practices, while DevOps emphasizes cultural changes and collaboration.

## CI/CD Tools

Development teams can use a wide range of [tools](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/best-ci-cd-tools) to impediment CI/CD practices in their everyday workflow.

**Some Popular CI/CD Tool Types Include:**

* **Continuous Integration (CI) Tools:** Automate the process of merging and testing code changes in a shared repository. They run automated builds and tests for each code commit, helping detect integration issues early and improving code quality. Popular CI tools include [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/continuous-integration/), and [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/).
* **Continuous Delivery (CD) Tools:** Automate the process of preparing code for deployment to production. They extend continuous integration by automating the [deployment pipeline](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/what-is-a-devops-pipeline), including the build, test, and release stages. These tools ensure that code changes are always in a deployable state and can be released to production with minimal manual intervention. Popular CD tools include Jenkins, [GitLab CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/devsecops/?utm\_medium=cpc\&utm\_source=google\&utm\_campaign=brand\_amer\_pr\_rsa\_br\_exact\_free-trial\_\&utm\_content=free-trial&\_bt=654402617438&\_bk=gitlab%20ci%20cd&\_bm=e&\_bn=g&\_bg=142303747195\&gad\_source=1\&gclid=CjwKCAjwhvi0BhA4EiwAX25ujy8fAY8SY7vvNvtgntk8PY6W\_m9YTJ6ka3jmYaR6Dp3kDClGrnQmQxoCpY4QAvD\_BwE), and [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/).
* **Containerization and Orchestration Tools:** Tools such as [Docker](https://pagertree.com/learn/docker/overview) package applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring they run consistently across different environments. Orchestration tools, like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), manage and automate the deployment, scaling, and operation of these containerized applications. Together, they enhance application portability, simplify management, and improve scalability and resilience.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tools:** Allow developers to define infrastructure configurations in declarative or imperative scripts, ensuring consistent and repeatable setups. Popular IaC tools include [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), which is cloud-agnostic, [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) for AWS-specific infrastructure, and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), which automates configuration management and application deployment. IaC tools streamline infrastructure management, reduce manual errors, and enhance scalability.
* **Monitoring and Logging Tools:** Track the performance, health, and activity of applications and infrastructure. Monitoring tools like [Prometheus](https://pagertree.com/learn/prometheus/overview), Nagios, and Grafana collect and visualize metrics to help detect and respond to issues. Logging tools [aggregate](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/data-aggregation-and-aggregators) and analyze log data to provide insights into system behavior and troubleshoot problems. These tools enhance [observability](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-observability), aiding in proactive maintenance and rapid issue resolution.

CI/CD improves the way software is developed and deployed, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software quickly and reliably. By automating the integration and delivery process, CI/CD minimizes risks, enhances collaboration, and ensures that software is always in a deployable state. Embracing CI/CD, along with the right tools and best practices, empowers organizations to stay competitive in the ever-evolving software business.
