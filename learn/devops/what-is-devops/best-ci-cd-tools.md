# Best CI/CD Tools

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery ([CI/CD](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/what-is-ci-cd)) are critical components in modern software development. They enable[ DevOps teams](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops) and other developers to automate testing, integration, and [deployment](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-site-reliability-engineering-sre/what-is-blue-green-deployment) processes.
