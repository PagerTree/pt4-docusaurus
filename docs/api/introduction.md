# Introduction

The PagerTree API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

We support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors.

The PagerTree API doesn't support bulk updates. You can work on only one object per request.
