## User Creation and Setup

[Users](https://pagertree.com/docs/users) are created in PagerTree via the user dashboard by [admins](https://pagertree.com/docs/teams#team-roles). This requires the new user's name and email. Once an admin has [invited](https://pagertree.com/docs#inviting-users) a new user to join their account, that user will receive an email from [support@pagertree.com](mailto:support@pagertree.com). You will follow these steps to create your account.

3. You can utilize other features here, such as “[Going On-Call Notifications](https://pagertree.com/docs/users#going-on-call-notifications)” and “[Persistent Notifications](https://pagertree.com/docs/notifications#notification-persistence-push-1),” but these are not required.
4. **Scroll** down and **Click** the **Update Button**.

## Alert Status and Response

[Alerts](https://pagertree.com/docs/alerts) in PagerTree are actionable issues that require user interaction. You will receive notifications to notify you of alerts, and you will need to proceed to the PagerTree Web UI or mobile app to interact further with them.\
\
PagerTree [alert statuses](https://pagertree.com/docs/alerts#alert-states) typically fall into three unique states.

1. **Open**: The alert has been routed to its first destination. It has an open workflow and is waiting to be actively acknowledged.
2. **Acknowledged**: A user has acknowledged the alert.
3. **Resolved**: The alert has been marked as resolved by a user or integration.

As an on-call user, you will follow the following steps when an alert is created.

1. A notification will be received via your [preferred notification method.](https://pagertree.com/docs/users#default-notification-channels)
2. **Acknowledge** the **Alert**.
3. **Proceed** to the **alert dashboard** for any additional alert information
4. Resolve the root cause that triggered the alert.
5. **Resolve** the **Alert** in PagerTree.
