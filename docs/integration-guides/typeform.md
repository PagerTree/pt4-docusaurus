## What is Typeform?

[Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) helps users build beautiful, engaging, and conversational online forms, surveys, quizzes, landing pages.

## How It Works

Typeform hosts forms that are submitted by users.

* When a form is submitted in Typeform, an alert is created in PagerTree automatically.
