# üì£ PagerTree Live Call Routing

Today, we are excited to announce PagerTree now officially supports [Live Call Routing](https://pagertree.com/docs/integration-guides/twilio/live-call-routing)! With Live Call Routing you can route incoming phone calls to the right person using your existing on-call schedules and escalation policies.

## Live Call Routing Features <a href="#live-call-routing" id="live-call-routing"></a>

* Purchase and manage global phone numbers using [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
* Route incoming phone calls to PagerTree teams with [on-call schedules](https://docs.pagertree.com/knowledge-base/schedules) and [escalation layers](https://docs.pagertree.com/knowledge-base/escalation-policies)
* Have the caller leave a voicemail if for some reason the on-call can‚Äôt answer
* Customize ‚Äúhold music‚Äù and ‚Äúvoicemail message‚Äù

Better yet, [Live Call Routing](https://pagertree.com/features/live-call-routing/) can be configured to route to multiple teams. When configured to route to multiple teams, callers will be presented with team options. For example: ‚ÄúPress 1 for Devops, Press 2 for Network Operations, Press 3 for Security‚Äù.

Live Call Routing is available on our [Elite pricing plan](https://pagertree.com/pricing/?utm\_source=blog\&utm\_medium=link\&utm\_campaign=pagertree\_live\_call\_routing). To get setup, make sure to follow the [integration guide](https://pagertree.com/docs/integration-guides/twilio/live-call-routing).

I hope you can take advantage of this new feature and add real-time conversations to your support workflow!
