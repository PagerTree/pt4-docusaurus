# ðŸª„ Slack Channel Stakeholder Notifications

Recently, while working with a customer, I saw a really cool use of [PagerTreeâ€™s Stakeholder Notifications](https://docs.pagertree.com/knowledge-base/stakeholders) to send messages into a Slack channel. They did this by using the Slackâ€™s [Email to Slack](https://pagertree.slack.com/apps/A0F81496D-email) integration along with PagerTreeâ€™s Stakeholder notifications. Today Iâ€™d like to share with you how they did it.

2. A [Slack](https://slack.com/) account with a [premium plan](https://slack.com/pricing).

## In PagerTree

### Create a Stakeholder

1. Enable [Advanced Mode](https://docs.pagertree.com/knowledge-base/users#advanced-mode).
2. [Create a stakeholder](https://app.pagertree.com/stakeholders/new) group.
3. Paste the Slack email address in the additional emails section of the PagerTree stakeholder.
4. Click Create.

## Test it Out

ðŸš€ Now test it out by manually creating an incident in PagerTree. You should see Slack shows a notification in the #stakeholder channel.

I hope you found this useful, and can use it to keep stakeholders informed during ongoing incidents.
