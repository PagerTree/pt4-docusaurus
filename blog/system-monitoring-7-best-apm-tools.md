# üëë What is System Monitoring?

As service providers, we understand that [100% uptime](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/common-metrics#uptime) for our service isn't an achievable goal, but we do everything in our power to provide our customers with the best possible service and [highest availability](https://pagertree.com/blog/sre-metrics-availability) possible. We implement tools and processes to allow ourselves the ability to respond to issues before they affect our customers. One type of tool we implement is system monitoring tools. The tools give us [observability](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-observability) for all of our systems. Access to all of our systems in a clean, easy-to-read dashboard helps us see trends and issues before they become serious problems. Understanding our systems and resolving issues before our customers see them helps improve customer satisfaction and service uptime and helps us meet our SLAs, but what is system monitoring?

<!-- truncate -->

System monitoring, also known as ‚Äúapplication performance monitoring‚Äù (APM), is the process of tracking and evaluating the performance and health of a service provider‚Äôs infrastructure.

Monitored systems can include:

* Servers
* Networks
* Applications
* Configurations

APM tools allow system administrators to instrument, collect, and analyze crucial operational insights to keep systems operating at their peak.

### What To Look For In Your System Monitoring Software

When evaluating an APM tool, consider these 5 key factors to ensure you are picking the right tool to monitor your systems.

- **Reliability:** Monitoring software's primary role is to provide consistent and accurate data on your system's health and performance. The software should have a proven track record of minimal downtime and accurate measurement, reporting, and alerting.
- **Scalability:** APM tools must be able to grow with your service, handling an increasing number of devices and metrics without a drop in performance.
- **Integrations:** The monitoring system you choose should easily fit into your existing technology stack. Its ability to integrate smoothly with other tools and platforms can significantly enhance its utility and the benefits you gain from it.
- **Pricing:** APM tools range in pricing anywhere from free to hundreds of dollars. Pricing should align with your budget and the value it delivers. Look for transparent pricing models that scale sensibly with your usage.
-**Ease of use:** System monitoring software should provide a user-friendly interface, clear documentation, and responsive customer support. This will dramatically improve the experience of setting up and maintaining your monitoring solution.

### Datadog: Modern Monitoring & Security

<figure>![Datadog APM tool](<.gitbook/assets/Datadog_logo.svg.png>)<figcaption><p>Datadog Logo</p></figcaption></figure>

[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a widely used application performance monitoring tool, thanks to its extensive list of over [700 built-in integrations](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/) that make it highly adaptable for any stack. The company promises a [99.8% uptime](https://www.datadoghq.com/legal/terms/2014-12-31/#service-level-commitment), ensuring its tools are available when you require them the most. Datadog is unmatched in the services it provides, encompassing everything from log management to full infrastructure monitoring.

They champion their ‚Äú[AI-powered ](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-bits-generative-ai/)code level distributed tracing tool, Watchdog,‚Äù which enables users to ‚Äúdetect and resolve root causes faster,‚Äù improving application performance and security. This Watchdog AI automates root cause analysis, helps detect anomalies, and minimizes downtime.

<figure>![Watchdog AI APM tool addon](<.gitbook/assets/watchdogai.png>)<figcaption><p>Watchdog AI APM tool addon</p></figcaption></figure>

The Datadog APM plan advertises a cost of $36/month per [host](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account\_management/billing/#hosts), but in order to utilize the APM tool you are required to also have an [Infrustrure plan](https://www.datadoghq.com/pricing/?product=infrastructure#products). These start at $18/month per host. This brings the cost of Datadog (on its face) to $54/month per host at its base level.\

System monitoring or APM tools are essential for maintaining uptimes, detecting service failures, and evaluating performance. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a service with high uptimes, every integration under the sun, or unmatched services, there is a tool that fits your needs. When selecting an APM tool, factors like reliability, scalability, integration, cost, and usability must be considered to meet the current and future needs of your business. System monitors are only one tool in your arsenal to maintain service levels and improve overall performance.
