# ðŸ“£ WhatsApp Notifications

PagerTree now supports [WhatsApp notifications](https://pagertree.com/features/whatsapp-notifications/)! Now, you can get notified about PagerTree alerts, incidents, broadcasts, and on-call reminders from WhatsApp.

WhatsApp notifications are a great alternative to SMS messages and are the preferred way of communication in many countries (e.g., [Netherlands](https://pagertree.com/features/whatsapp-notifications/netherlands-oncall-notifications), [Germany](https://pagertree.com/features/whatsapp-notifications/deutschland-notifications), [South Africa](https://pagertree.com/features/whatsapp-notifications/south-africa-oncall-notifications), [Mexico](https://pagertree.com/features/whatsapp-notifications/mexico-oncall-notifications), etc.).

WhatsApp Notifications are available on our [Pro and Elite pricing plans](https://pagertree.com/pricing?utm\_source=blog\&utm\_medium=link\&utm\_campaign=whatsapp\_notifications).
