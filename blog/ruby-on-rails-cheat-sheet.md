## Ruby Syntax

### Hashes

[Hashes](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/built\_in\_classes/hashes.html) were one of the most confusing things to me when first starting ruby (not because they are a new concept, but because I found the syntax very hard to read). In newer versions, syntax is very similar to JSON notification. Just know there are two versions of syntax, an older and newer one.

```ruby
# Old Syntax
{ :one => "eins", :two => "zwei", :three => "drei" }

# New Syntax
{ one: "eins", two: "zwei", three: "drei" } 
```

Also, you can have [symbols](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/built\_in\_classes/symbols.html) as keys for hashes, and they **do not** lookup the same values as strings.

```ruby
# notice the colon in front of our key
hash = {:one => "eins"} 

hash[:one] # results in "eins"
hash["one"] # results in nil
```

### Safe Navigation Operator

Instead of checking for nil or undefined values, you can use the safe navigation operator. There‚Äôs a nice article [here](https://mitrev.net/ruby/2015/11/13/the-operator-in-ruby/) that goes into more depth of explanation.

```ruby
# do this
if user&.email&.verified?

# instead of this
if user && user.email && user.email.verified?
```

### ERB

**Evaluation and Output**

Evaluation can be done with the `<% %>` syntax and output can be achieved with the `<%= %>` syntax.

```ruby
<% if user.is_subscribed? %>
  You are subscribed to the <%= user.plan.name %> plan!
<% end %>
```

#### **Partials**

You can render partials like so:

```erb
<%= render partial: "shared/_nav_links" %>
```

## Rails commands

Common rails commands. (Note: ‚Äúrails g‚Äù stands for ‚Äúrails generate‚Äù)

| Command                                                            | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rails g model user name:string age:integer account:references`    | Generates model and migration files                                                            |
| `rails g scaffold user name:string age:integer account:references` | Generates controller, model, migration, view, and test files. Also modifies `config/routes.rb` |
| `rails g scaffold_controller user`                                 | Generates controller and view files. Useful if you already have the model                      |

## Rake Commands

Common rake commands for database management and finding routes.

| Command                             | Description                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rake routes`                       | View all routes in application (pair with `grep` command for some nifty searching) |
| `rake db:seed`                      | Seed the database using the `db/seeds.rb`                                          |
| `rake db:migrate`                   | Run any pending migrations                                                         |
| `rake db:rollback`                  | Rollback a database migration (add STEP=2 to remove multiple migrations)           |
| `rake db:drop db:create db:migrate` | Destroy the database, re-created it, and run migrations (useful for development)   |

## Rails Framework

### Migration Data Types

Migration data types. Here is the [source](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/SchemaStatements.html#method-i-add\_column) and a [stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17918117/rails-4-list-of-available-datatypes) I commonly reference.

* :boolean
* :date
* :datetime
* :decimal
* :float
* :integer
* :primary\_key
* :references
* :string
* :text
* :time
* :timestamp

### Controller Filters

Filters are methods that are run ‚Äúbefore‚Äù, ‚Äúafter‚Äù or ‚Äúaround‚Äù a controller action. See [full action controller filters documentation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action\_controller\_overview.html#filters) for details.

Before filters are registered via the `before_action` and **can** halt the request cycle.

```ruby title="controllers/application.rb"
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :require_login

  private

  def require_login
    unless logged_in?
      flash[:error] = "You must be logged in to access this section"
      redirect_to new_login_url # halts request cycle

    end
  end
end
```

### Models Callbacks

Gusto has a really nice article one [best practices for model callbacks](https://engineering.gusto.com/the-rails-callbacks-best-practices-used-at-gusto/).

This table references the [ruby on rails documentation for active record callbacks](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active\_record\_callbacks.html#available-callbacks). Check out the full documentation for other special callbacks like `after_touch`.

| New Record                      | Updating Record                 | Destroying Record               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| save                            | save                            | destroy                         |
| save!                           | save!                           | destroy!                        |
| create                          | update\_attribute               |                                 |
| create!                         | update                          |                                 |
|                                 | update!                         |                                 |
|                                 |                                 |                                 |
| before\_validation              | before\_validation              |                                 |
| after\_validation               | after\_validation               |                                 |
| before\_save                    | before\_save                    |                                 |
| around\_save                    | around\_save                    |                                 |
| before\_create                  | before\_update                  | before\_destroy                 |
| around\_create                  | around\_update                  | around\_destroy                 |
| after\_create                   | after\_update                   | after\_destroy                  |
| after\_save                     | after\_save                     |                                 |
| after\_commit / after\_rollback | after\_commit / after\_rollback | after\_commit / after\_rollback |

```ruby title="models/user.rb"
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # Send a welcome email after they are created
  after_create :send_welcome_email
end
```

### Model Queries

A couple of basic (and most commonly used) queries are below. You can find the full documentation [here](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active\_record\_querying.html#retrieving-objects-from-the-database).

| Command Example                              | Description                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Model.find(10)`                             | Find model by id                                               |
| `Model.find_by({ name: "Austin" })`          | Find models where conditions                                   |
| `Model.where("name = ?", params[:name])`     | Find models where condition                                    |
| `Model.where.not("name = ?", params[:name])` | Find models where condition not true                           |
| `Model.first`                                | Get the first model in the collection (ordered by primary key) |
| `Model.last`                                 | Get the lst model in the collection (ordered by primary key)   |
| `Model.order(:created_at)`                   | Order your results or query                                    |
| `Model.select(:id, :name)`                   | Select only specific fields                                    |
| `Model.limit(10).offset(20)`                 | Limit and offset (great for pagination)                        |

### **Fastest Check For Existence**

Additionally, you are likely to want to check for an existence of a condition many times. There are many ways to do this, namely present?, any?, empty?, and exists? but the `exists?` method will be the fastest. This [semaphore article](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/2017/03/14/faster-rails-how-to-check-if-a-record-exists.html) explains nicely why `exists?` is the fastest method for checking if one of a query exists.

```ruby
Model.where().exists?
```

### Application Configuration

Application configuration should be located in `config/application.rb` with specific environment configurations in `config/environments/`. **Don‚Äôt put sensitive data in your configuration files, that‚Äôs what the secrets are for.** You can access configurations in your application code with the following:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.property_name
```

### Application Secrets

Application secrets are just that, **secret** (think API keys). You can edit the secrets file using the following commands `rails credentials:edit --environment=env_name`. This will create files in the `config/credentials/` folder. You‚Äôll get two files:

1. `environment.yml.enc` - This is your secrets encrypted - This can be put this into git
2. `environment.key` - This contains the key that encrypts the file - **DO NOT** put this into git.

Additionally, when deploying, the key inside the `environment.key` file will need to be placed into the `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` environment variable. You can then access secrets in your rails code like so:

```ruby
Rails.application.credentials[:key_name]
```
