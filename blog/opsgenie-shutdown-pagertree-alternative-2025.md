# ðŸ“£ OpsGenie Shutdown Announced: Why PagerTree Is Your Best Alternative in 2025

The incident management landscape is shifting, and for [OpsGenie](https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie) users, change is on the horizon. [Atlassian recently announced](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/evolution-of-it-operations) that OpsGenie, a staple in on-call and alerting solutions, will no longer be available for new purchases after **June 4, 2025**, with full support ending on **April 5, 2027**. This news has left many teams scrambling to find a reliable alternative that ensures seamless incident response without breaking the bank. If youâ€™re an OpsGenie user, now is the time to evaluate your optionsâ€”and [**PagerTree**](https://pagertree.com) stands out as the smartest choice to future-proof your operations.

In this article, weâ€™ll break down the OpsGenie shutdown, explore why itâ€™s happening, and show you why PagerTree is the ideal replacement for modern teams. Letâ€™s dive in.

## Whatâ€™s Happening with OpsGenie?

Atlassian acquired OpsGenie in 2018, integrating it into their ecosystem alongside tools like Jira and Confluence. For years, itâ€™s been a go-to for DevOps and IT teams needing robust alerting and on-call management. However, Atlassianâ€™s recent announcement signals a strategic pivot. Theyâ€™re folding OpsGenieâ€™s capabilities into [Jira Service Management](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management) and [Compass](https://www.atlassian.com/software/compass), aiming to streamline their offerings. While existing users have until April 2027 to migrate, the clock is tickingâ€”no new OpsGenie instances will be sold after mid-2025.&#x20;

This isnâ€™t just a product sunset; itâ€™s a wake-up call. OpsGenieâ€™s reliability has been questioned beforeâ€”remember the [14-day outage in April 2022](https://www.atlassian.com/engineering/post-incident-review-april-2022-outage)? That kind of downtime is unacceptable for a tool meant to keep services _always on_. With Atlassian prioritizing its broader suite, teams relying on standalone incident management need a solution thatâ€™s dependable, affordable, and built for the long haul.

## Why Teams Are Looking Beyond OpsGenie

Even before the shutdown news, OpsGenie users had reasons to [explore alternatives](https://pagertree.com/blog/top-5-best-pagerduty-alternatives-in-2024):

* **Cost Creep**: OpsGenieâ€™s pricing starts at $9/user/month, but advanced features like live call routing come with additional fees, pushing costs higher for growing teams.
* **Reliability Risks**: The 2022 outage exposed vulnerabilities in Atlassianâ€™s infrastructure, leaving some users in the lurch for weeks.
* **Complexity**: While feature-rich, OpsGenieâ€™s integration with Atlassian tools can feel clunky for teams not fully embedded in their ecosystem.

With the shutdown looming, these concerns are magnified. Teams need an incident management tool thatâ€™s stable, scalable, and wonâ€™t leave them stranded during a crisis. Enter [**PagerTree**](https://pagertree.com).
