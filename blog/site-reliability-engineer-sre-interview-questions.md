## SRE Interview Questions Answers and Resources

### 1. Can you explain what Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is?

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a [DevOps](https://app.gitbook.com/s/N7Juqw2CotfGq49GwfMF/devops/what-is-devops) discipline that applies software engineering principles to infrastructure and operations to create scalable and highly reliable software systems.

### 2. What are the key principles of SRE?

* **Embracing and managing risk -** Utilizing error budget to implement and test new features.
* **Maintaining Service Level Objectives -** Tracking and comparing SLIs to your SLOs to ensure you meet your SLA.&#x20;
* **Eliminating toil -** Reducing repetitive mundane tasks that can be automated, allowing for better use of time.
* **Monitoring -** Keeping track of systems and performance to address issues before they become real problems.
* **Automation -** Implementing automation to reduce toil.
* **Release engineering -** The technical aspects of compiling, assembling, and delivering source code.&#x20;
* **Simplicity -** Its easier to understand the effect of small simple changes over large batch changes.

For a more in-depth information on the key principles of SRE can be found [here](https://sre.google/sre-book/part-II-principles/).

### 3. What are the 4 Golden Signals of SRE?

* **Latency -** The amount of time your services take to fulfill a request.
* **Traffic -** The number of requests your service receives.
* **Errors -** The number of unsuccessful requests both overall and at specific end points.
* **Saturation -** The utilization of resources in comparison to their capacity.

For a more in-depth information on the 4 Golden Signals of SRE can be found [here](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-site-reliability-engineering-sre/four-golden-signals-sre-monitoring).

### 4. How do you define and measure Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs)?

[SLOs](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli#what-is-a-service-level-objective-slo) are typically written and set by product managers to meet or exceed promises made in the company's [SLA](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli#what-is-a-service-level-agreement-sla). SLOs are typically written to give teams an [error budget](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/how-to-calculate-mttr-and-other-common-incident-recovery-metrics#error-budget) and room for experimentation. [SLIs](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli#what-is-a-service-level-indicator-sli) are the actual measured performance of the service being provided indicating whether the performance is meeting SLOs and SLAs.\

### 5. What is error budget, and what role does it play in SRE?

[Error budget](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/how-to-calculate-mttr-and-other-common-incident-recovery-metrics#error-budget) is the difference in performance between your SLA and SLO that allows for downtime, performance issues, and feature experimentation.

### 6. SRE vs DevOps: What's the difference?

[SRE](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-site-reliability-engineering-sre) focuses on engineering solutions for system reliability and performance, while [DevOps ](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops)emphasizes collaborative practices to enhance and streamline the software development and delivery process.

### 7. What is the importance of monitoring and alerting in SRE? What tools have you used?

Monitoring and alerting are important in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) because they help identify potential issues before they cause outages. [Monitoring tools](https://pagertree.com/blog/system-monitoring-7-best-apm-tools) provide real-time insights into system performance, infrastructure health, and user behavior.\
\
Monitoring Tools Include:

* [**Datadog**](https://www.datadoghq.com/)
* [**PRTG**](https://www.paessler.com/)
* [**New Relic**](https://newrelic.com/)
* [**SolarWinds**](https://www.solarwinds.com/)

Alerting Tools Include:

* [**PagerTree**](https://pagertree.com/)
* [**OnPage**](https://www.onpage.com/)
* [**Xmatters**](https://www.xmatters.com/)

### 8. What is the difference between logging, monitoring, and tracing?

* **Logging -**  captures detailed records of events within a system, which is useful for diagnosing specific issues.
* **Monitoring -**  continuously tracks system metrics for real-time health and performance insights.
* **Tracing -** follows the flow of requests through a system to pinpoint bottlenecks and understand interactions.

### 9. Explain DNS and its importance.

DNS or [Domain Name System](https://www.itsasap.com/blog/what-is-dns) translates domain names into IP addresses so browsers can load webpages. DNS servers allow the average user to type words into their browser and find the pages they are looking for without having a phonebook of IP addresses.

### 10. How do you prioritize which alerts to respond to first during an incident?

The first step to prioritizing alerts is to understand the [severity level](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/severity-levels) of the incident, who it affects, and what kind of impact it will have on your customers or systems. After determining the severity level, you can prioritize alerts starting from a SEV-1 level (highest, greatest impact) down to a SEV-5 (lowest, smallest impact).

<figure>![](<.gitbook/assets/Sevlevel.png>)<figcaption><p>Incident Severity Levels</p></figcaption></figure>

### 11. What is Chaos Engineering?

[Chaos Engineering](https://www.gremlin.com/community/tutorials/chaos-engineering-the-history-principles-and-practice) is a methodical approach to discovering failures before they lead to outages. By proactively testing how a system responds to stress, you can pinpoint and resolve failures before they become problems that affect your customers and systems. [Chaos Monkey](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey) is a popular tool used in Chaos Engineering.

### 12. How do you handle capacity planning and scaling for high-traffic applications?

* **Use load balancing -** [Distribute requests](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/load-balancing/) across multiple servers, optimizing resource utilization.
* **Cache frequently accessed data -** Improve response time and scalability by [storing frequently accessed data](https://builtin.com/articles/caching).
* **Automate testing -** [Stress test](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/automated-software-testing) your system to identify bottlenecks in performance. Use continuous integration tools (like [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions)) to automatically test code changes.
* **Monitor systems -** [Utilize APM tools](https://pagertree.com/blog/system-monitoring-7-best-apm-tools) to provide real-time insight into your system’s performance and health to detect issues before they affect customers.
* **Design your system to scale -** [Scale your system](https://scalac.io/blog/scaling-application-best-practices-and-strategies/) up or down to meet the needs of traffic to maintain performance.

### 13. What are containers on a server?

[Containers](https://pagertree.com/learn/docker/containers) are self-contained software packages that can run in any environment without any modifications. They virtualize the operating system and are capable of running in various settings, including private data centers and public clouds. [Docker](https://pagertree.com/learn/docker/overview) is a common containerization tool.

### 14. What is database sharding?

[Database sharding](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/products/capabilities/database-sharding-explained) involves distributing a large database across multiple machines. Since a single machine or database server can only handle a limited amount of data, sharding splits the data into smaller logical chunks called shards and stores them across multiple database servers to overcome this limitation.

### 15. How will you secure your Docker containers?

* **Avoid running Docker containers with root permissions -** While this may make dealing with permission management easier, you open up the container to risk.
* **Use secure container registries -** Utilizing secure registries like [Docker Trusted Registry](https://dockerlabs.collabnix.com/beginners/dockertrustedregistry.html) helps prevent potential security risks.
* **Limit container resource usage -** This helps prevent attacks on your systems from resource exhaustion from those looking to disrupt your service.
* **Scan images -** Scanning [images](https://pagertree.com/learn/docker/images) regularly for vulnerabilities helps prevent security risks. Tools like [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) can help with automated container scanning.
* **Monitor containers -** Utilize monitoring tools like ([Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) or [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/)) to [monitor](https://www.tigera.io/learn/guides/container-security-best-practices/docker-container-monitoring/) your containers, gaining visibility and observability.

### 16. What is observability?

The concept of [observability](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-observability) refers to the ability to understand the internal state of a software system based on its external outputs. It involves using data and insights from monitoring to understand the system's health and performance. [Observability methods include USE and RED](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-observability/use-and-red-method).

### 17. What is DHCP?

DHCP or [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/dhcp/dhcp-top) is the protocol that provides an Internet Protocol (IP) host with its IP address as well as any additional necessary configurations.

### 18. Can you explain the difference between a blue-green and canary deployment?

Blue-green deployment involves running two identical environments (blue and green). One environment handles live traffic, while the other is used for testing new releases before directing traffic to it, making it easy to revert if necessary. In contrast, [canary deployment](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-site-reliability-engineering-sre/what-is-a-canary-deployment) introduces the new version gradually to a small group of users before a full release, enabling step-by-step validation and reducing the impact of any potential issues.

### 19. How do you approach security and compliance in an SRE Role?

* **Implement access controls -** Ensure only those you trust have access to sensitive systems and information.
* **Conduct regular security checks -** Identify [vulnerabilities](https://pagertree.com/learn/devops/what-is-devops/what-is-devsecops) and risks often and early.
* **Monitor and log activity -** Proactively monitor systems and logs for suspicious activities.
* **Implement backups and disaster recovery -** Having backups helps you recover systems quickly and effectively.

### 20. What is the difference between TCP and UDP?

Transmission control protocol or TCP is a reliable connection-based protocol. While more reliable than UDP, data transfers are slower. [User Datagram Protocol](https://www.avast.com/c-tcp-vs-udp-difference) or UDP is a less reliable connectionless protocol that works faster than TCP. You can think of TCP as a “handshake” communication technology, and UDP as a ”broadcast/shout to the ether” communication technology.

::video-youtube[In-depth TCP vs UDP]{#jE_FcgpQ7Co}

### 21. Explain the difference between IaaS, PaaS and SaaS.

* **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** -  provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, giving users control over the operating systems, storage, and deployed applications. Examples include [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw0ruyBhDuARIsANSZ3woABXoh8z4o6z6\_1WDnsB16TIXOgPPTRxYRjJMxnL4YJThkV8CDSmoaAkMHEALw\_wcB\&trk=6a4c3e9d-cdc9-4e25-8dd9-2bd8d15afbca\&sc\_channel=ps\&ef\_id=Cj0KCQjw0ruyBhDuARIsANSZ3woABXoh8z4o6z6\_1WDnsB16TIXOgPPTRxYRjJMxnL4YJThkV8CDSmoaAkMHEALw\_wcB:G:s\&s\_kwcid=AL!4422!3!651751059783!e!!g!!aws!19852662197!145019195897\&all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank\&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc\&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=\*all\&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=\*all), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us), and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en).
* **PaaS (Platform as a Service) -** offers a platform for developers to build, run, and manage applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. Examples include [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), [Fly.io](http://fly.io), and [Render](https://render.com/).
* **SaaS (Software as a Service) -**  delivers fully functional software applications over the internet, accessible via web browsers, with the provider handling all underlying infrastructure and maintenance. Examples include [PagerTree](https://pagertree.com/), [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/), and [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).

### 22. What is SSH, and how does it work?

[The Secure Shell](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ssh/) (SSH) protocol provides a secure way to send commands to a computer over an unsecured network. It uses cryptography to authenticate and encrypt connections between devices.

### 23. What is toil reduction, and how is it achieved?

Toil is a term used to describe manual, repetitive, and tedious tasks that engineers perform in production environments. [Toil reduction](https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/) is the process of reducing the amount of time spent on tasks that are considered toil. This can be achieved through process automation.

### 24. What is white-box monitoring?

[White-box monitoring](https://faun.dev/c/stories/eon01/monitoring-vs-observability-whats-the-difference/) is a method of monitoring the internal metrics of applications that run on a server when you can access its source code.

### 25. What is black-box monitoring?

[Black box monitoring](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/#Black-Box%20Versus%20White-Box) is a type of application monitoring that focuses on an application's external behavior without needing access to its source code.
