## What is PagerDuty?

[PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/) is a leading incident management platform that has been around since 2009. PagerDuty aims to streamline an organization's incident response process. It has features like on-call scheduling, escalation policies, and alerts.

But, PagerDuty can be expensive, has a steep learning curve, and lacks customer support. We‚Äôve compiled a list of the top 5 best PagerDuty alternatives. We specifically looked at features, reliability, and pricing.

## Why Choose a PagerDuty Alternative?

PagerDuty offers a robust incident management solution. However, there are many reasons why people might explore alternatives.

1. **Cost** - PagerDuty paid plans start at $25/user/month. Cost conscience organizations will be looking for more cost-effective alternatives. (Note: when comparing pricing below, we will compare plans that support Single Sign On)
2. **Feature Set** - PagerDuty offers many features. Some might even call it feature bloat. Most organizations only need the core subset, like on-call, escalations, and notifications. Why pay for features you don‚Äôt use?
3. **Learning Curve** - PagerDuty can be complex to set up and learn. Most teams will want a solution that is easy to set up and simple to understand. Time to go live is critical for small and agile teams.
4. **Customer Service** - PagerDuty is the largest and most well-known brand for on-call incident management software. However, their customer service and support are lacking, especially for small accounts. Businesses will be looking for the best customer support possible.

## What Makes A Great Incident Management Platform?

When evaluating PagerDuty alternatives, consider the following criteria to make the best decision possible:

1. **Core Features** - The tool, at a minimum, should have on-call scheduling, escalation policies, and notifications. Additional features like [live call routing](https://pagertree.com/blog/pagertree-live-call-routing) and reporting are also a plus.
2. **Ease of Use** - Is the tool easy to use and understandable? How easy is it to onboard new users? You don‚Äôt want to be confused when figuring out who is on-call, especially during an incident.
3. **Integration Capabilities** - Ensure the tool integrates with your team‚Äôs existing toolset.
4. **Reliability** - Check the tool‚Äôs historical [uptime](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/common-metrics#uptime) (usually found at https://status.domain.com). The tool should have minimal downtime. The tool‚Äôs vendor should also communicate clearly and effectively during an outage.
5. **Scalability** - Can the tool scale with your organization? Price, feature set, and onboarding should be considered when considering scalability.
6. **Support and Training** - Does the tool have easy-to-read support and training documentation?

By carefully assessing these criteria, you can identify the best PagerDuty alternative for your team's needs.

## Top 5 Best PagDuty Alternatives

Here's our list of the top 5 best PagerDuty alternatives in 2024.

### PagerTree

[PagerTree](https://pagertree.com/?utm\_source=blog\&utm\_medium=link\&utm\_campaign=top\_5\_best\_pagerduty\_alternatives\_in\_2024) is the best overall alternative to PagerDuty. It is efficient for on-call scheduling and reliable for notifications. Additionally, it‚Äôs the most cost-effective solution on our list at $15/user/month.

### OpsGenie

[OpsGenie](https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie) is the best-known competitor to PagerDuty. They offer a streamlined approach to [incident management](https://pagertree.com/learn/incident-management/what-is-incident-management-beginners-guide).

OpsGenie has core features like on-call scheduling, escalations, and notifications. Their ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù price plan ($23/user/month) includes features like integrations and reports. Advanced features like live call routing are provided for a $10 upcharge per number.

:::warning
OpsGenie was acquired by Atlassian in 2018. Since then, its reliability has been called into question. In April 2022, OpsGenie had a 2-week (that‚Äôs not a misprint, yes, 14 days) outage. Unlucky customers were forced to move to an alternative solution. Otherwise, they had to wait until their account was prioritized for restoration.

### iLert

[iLert](https://www.ilert.com/) is the new kid on the block, but we actually really like this tool. iLert offers a modern user interface and reliable product that you would come to expect from a German startup.

iLert offers all the core features like on-call scheduling, escalations, and notifications. Additionally, iLert offers status pages and live call routing for an additional fee (+$5/user/month).

If you are a European customer or have strict data storage requirements, iLert might be for you. iLert is made and supported in Germany. If you are looking for US-based customer support, you could wait 12+ hours for responses.

iLert tagline: ‚ÄúOne platform for alerting, on-call management, and status pages.‚Äù

iLert value proposition: ‚ÄúOn-call management and status pages starting at $24/user/month‚Äù

### Splunk

Formerly known as VictorOps, [Splunk On-Call](https://www.splunk.com/en\_us/products/on-call.html) is an incident management tool. It caters to enterprise organizations.

Splunk offers all the core features like on-call schedules, escalations, and notifications. Splunk also bundles enterprise-focused features like Real User Monitoring (RUM), Log Observability, and Application Performance Monitoring (APM). The extra features come at the extra cost of complexity. Splunk can have a higher learning curve than other tools. Splunk doesn‚Äôt publish pricing, so you know it will be expensive.

Splunk‚Äôs tagline: ‚ÄúSplunk On-Call - Make expensive service outages a thing of the past. Remediate issues faster, reduce [on-call burnout](https://pagertree.com/blog/the-science-of-on-call), and keep your services up and running.‚Äù

### OnPage

[OnPage](https://www.onpage.com/) offers ‚Äúincident alert management‚Äù. They primarily target the healthcare industry, including hospitals, doctors, and nurses.

OnPage's primary benefit is that it offers HIPPA-compliant notifications. If you are looking for a healthcare-centric tool, OnPage could be for you. If you are not in the healthcare space, we suggest looking at another tool. OnPage's user interface and on-call scheduler lack modern ease of use. Only their marketing has adapted to target the IT space. Additionally, pricing is only offered in yearly installments.

OnPage tagline: ‚ÄúRise Above the Clutter¬Æ Elevate urgent notifications and facilitate secure team collaboration in critical situations.‚Äù

OnPage value proposition: ‚ÄúHIPPA compliant on-call scheduling and notifications starting at $29/user/month paid annually.‚Äù
