# ðŸ“£ Critical Alerts for iOS and iPhone

A new version of the PagerTree [iPhone app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pagertree/id1266437807) is available today that adds support for Apple's Critical Alerts.

Critical Alerts are special notifications that [bypass the device's mute switch](https://pagertree.com/docs/notifications#bypass-dn-d-i-phone), focus, and do not disturb settings to generate an audible notification in emergency situations. Critical Alerts are only available to applications that have applied and been approved by Apple.

By default, Critical Alerts will be created for all `critical` urgency alerts in PagerTree.
