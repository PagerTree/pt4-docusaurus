# üì£ PagerTree 4.0 is finally here!

Today I am excited to announce we have officially shipped PagerTree 4.0!

Here are the highlights:

1. **Reduced Pricing** - [Elite pricing](https://pagertree.com/pricing/) has been reduced from $20 to $15.
2. **Better UI** - Both desktop and mobile, your eyes (and mine) can be relieved.
3. **Better Docs** - New docs (with improved search) that are more clear and concise than before. [https://pagertree.com/docs/](https://pagertree.com/docs/)
4. **Multiple Accounts Per User** - Users can now be a part of multiple accounts.
5. **2FA** - [Two Factor Authentication](https://pagertree.com/docs/users#two-factor-authentication) will keep your account safer.

This effort has been a year and half in development and I sincerely want to thank each and every one of our customers for the constructive feedback, ideas, and countless hours on Zoom calls. Without you this journey wouldn‚Äôt be possible.

We are excited to get this major release shipped, just in time for the holidays. You can check out the full details of the upgrade [below](pagertree-4-has-arrived.md#full-upgrade-breakdown). Over the coming months we will continue to add features from our [original list](https://github.com/PagerTree/pt4-spec).

If you have any other features you think we could add or improve on, make sure to give us a shout! We love it when customers suggest new ideas.

Sincerely,

Austin
